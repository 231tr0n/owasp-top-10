# Broken Access Control

Under the /homeadmin thing you can see that there is a commented code which is the fix for the broken access control vunerability. You need to comment out the line just before the commented code for the vunerability to work.
As for the control gaining thing, the website is by default vunerable to broken access control vunerability and you can login as normal user and can gain access rights of prime users just by changing the /home to /homeadmin in url.
